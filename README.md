# Jit Shipper
An all in one tool to  launch apps with debugger entitlements, using libimobiledevice.

## TODO
- [ ] Finish [rusty_libimobiledevice](https://github.com/jkcoxson/rusty_libimobiledevice)
- [x] Impliment device searching
- [ ] Impliment device choice
- [ ] Impliment fetching list off apps from device
- [ ] Impliment choosing an app
- [x] Impliment downloading the proper iOS DMG
- [ ] Impliment mounting the iOS image when needed
- [ ] Impliment launching an app and detaching

We still have a long way to go, but once ``rusty_libimobiledevice`` is done these should be trivial to impliment.

## Dependencies
Requires a proper build of [rusty_libimobiledevice](https://github.com/jkcoxson/rusty_libimobiledevice)
